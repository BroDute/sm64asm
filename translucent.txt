Two ways to handle translucency:
Use environment colour combiner with a new alpha set on an 0xFB opcode, then use that in the setcombine (0xFC). In single cycle this means goodbye vertex alpha.

Or...
Just use vertex alpha which works both in vector light and vertex RGBA mode and use my setcombine with no 0xFB needed, and supports alpha gradients
